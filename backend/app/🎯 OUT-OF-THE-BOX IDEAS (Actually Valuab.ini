🎯 OUT-OF-THE-BOX IDEAS (Actually Valuable)
1. CONCEPT GAP DETECTOR ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The Problem:
Student gets aerodynamics question wrong. ExamSide shows solution. Student still doesn't understand WHY.
Your Solution:
When you get Q15 wrong, system says:

"You got this wrong because you don't understand:
1. Boundary layer separation (prerequisite)
2. Pressure gradients (foundation)

Before retrying this, solve these 3 easier questions:
→ Q7 (2015) - Boundary layer basics
→ Q12 (2018) - Pressure distribution  
→ Q8 (2020) - Simple separation case

Once you get all 3 right, come back to Q15."

7. INSTANT DOUBT SOLVER (Your RAG Advantage) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The Problem:
Student doesn't understand solution. Has to Google, watch YouTube, or ask teacher (slow).
Your Solution:
Question: "Why does Cp become negative here?"

ExamSide: Shows solution [END]

QBT: Shows solution + 

"💡 Need more help?

Your doubt: 'Why Cp negative?'

From Anderson Aerodynamics Ch 3.7:
'Negative Cp indicates pressure below freestream. 
This occurs when velocity exceeds freestream due to 
flow acceleration over curved surface...'

Still confused? Ask follow-up:
[Why does velocity increase?]
[What is freestream pressure?]
[Show me diagram]"

Speaks: "Why is Mach number important in compressible flow?"

AI responds (voice):
"Mach number tells us if we can ignore density changes. 
Below Mach 0.3, density varies less than 5%, so we use 
incompressible equations. Above 0.3, density changes 
significantly, requiring compressible flow equations.

Want me to show you an example?"

Student: "Yes, with a real aircraft"

AI: "Sure! F-16 at sea level, cruising at 300 m/s..."

🎯 OUT-OF-THE-BOX IDEAS (Actually Valuable)
1. CONCEPT GAP DETECTOR ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The Problem:
Student gets aerodynamics question wrong. ExamSide shows solution. Student still doesn't understand WHY.
Your Solution:
When you get Q15 wrong, system says:

"You got this wrong because you don't understand:
1. Boundary layer separation (prerequisite)
2. Pressure gradients (foundation)

Before retrying this, solve these 3 easier questions:
→ Q7 (2015) - Boundary layer basics
→ Q12 (2018) - Pressure distribution  
→ Q8 (2020) - Simple separation case

Once you get all 3 right, come back to Q15."

QBT: Shows solution + 

"💡 Need more help?

Your doubt: 'Why Cp negative?'

From Anderson Aerodynamics Ch 3.7:
'Negative Cp indicates pressure below freestream. 
This occurs when velocity exceeds freestream due to 
flow acceleration over curved surface...'

Still confused? Ask follow-up:
[Why does velocity increase?]
[What is freestream pressure?]

incompressible equations. Above 0.3, density changes 
significantly, requiring compressible flow equations.

Want me to show you an example?"
