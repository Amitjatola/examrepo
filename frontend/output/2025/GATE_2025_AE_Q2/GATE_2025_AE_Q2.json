      "reasoning": "The sentence describes an action ('playing tennis') that was ongoing for a duration in the past and was interrupted by another past action ('it suddenly started to rain'). This grammatical structure requires the Past Perfect Continuous tense. The Past Perfect Continuous tense is formed by 'had + been + verb-ing'. Option B, 'had been playing', correctly forms this tense, indicating that the action of playing tennis had been in progress for some time before the rain started. Other options are incorrect: 'have been playing' is Present Perfect Continuous (action continuing to present), 'would have been playing' is Conditional Perfect Continuous (hypothetical past), and 'could be playing' implies present/future possibility. The phrase 'When it suddenly started to rain' establishes a simple past interrupting event, confirming the need for a past continuous tense that precedes it."
