The angle at the center for each triangle is $360^\\circ / 12 = 30^\\circ$. The area of one such triangle can be calculated using the formula $Area = \\frac{1}{2}ab \\sin(C)$, where $a=r$, $b=r$, and $C=30^\\circ$. \\n$Area_{triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times r \\times r \\times \\sin(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} r^2$. \\nThe squares to be formed have a side length of 'r'. The area of one square is $Area_{square} = r^2$. \\nTo find out how many triangles are required to form one square, we divide the area of the square by the area of one triangle: \\n$Number\\ of\\ triangles\\ per\\ square = \\frac{Area_{square}}{Area_{triangle}} = \\frac{r^2}{\\frac{1}{4} r^2} = 4$. \\nSince there are 12 triangles available in total, the number of squares that can be formed is $Total\\ triangles / (Triangles\\ per\\ square) = 12 / 4 = 3$. \\nTherefore, 3 squares can be formed, and 4 triangles are required for each square. This corresponds to option A."

        "Step 1: Understand the geometry of the dodecagon. A regular dodecagon inscribed in a circle of radius 'r' consists of 12 identical isosceles triangles, each with two sides equal to 'r' (the radius) and the third side being 'd' (the side of the dodecagon).",
        "Step 2: Determine the central angle of each triangle. Since there are 12 identical triangles forming a full circle at the center, the angle at the center for each triangle is $360^\\circ / 12 = 30^\\circ$.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the area of one of these triangles. Using the formula for the area of a triangle given two sides and the included angle ($Area = \\frac{1}{2}ab \\sin(C)$), we have $a=r$, $b=r$, and $C=30^\\circ$. So, $Area_{triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times r \\times r \\times \\sin(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} r^2$.",
        "Step 4: Calculate the area of the target square. The problem states that squares of side 'r' cm are to be formed. The area of one such square is $Area_{square} = r^2$.",
        "Step 5: Determine the number of triangles required to form one square. Divide the area of one square by the area of one triangle: $Number\\ of\\ triangles\\ per\\ square = \\frac{Area_{square}}{Area_{triangle}} = \\frac{r^2}{\\frac{1}{4} r^2} = 4$.",
        "Step 6: Calculate the total number of squares that can be formed. With 12 triangles available in total and 4 triangles needed for each square, the total number of squares is $12 / 4 = 3$."
