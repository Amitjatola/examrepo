      "reasoning": "Let $W(a)$ be the weight function, where 'a' is age. The problem states that $W(a)$ monotonically increases until $a=50$ years and then monotonically decreases. This implies that $W(a)$ has a unique maximum value at $a=50$. We are given two ages, $a_1$ and $a_2$, such that $a_1 < a_2$, and the condition that the brothers attain the same weight, i.e., $W(a_1) = W(a_2)$.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n\n1.  **A. $a_1 < a_2 < 50$**: In this interval, $W(a)$ is strictly monotonically increasing. If $a_1 < a_2$, then it must be that $W(a_1) < W(a_2)$. This contradicts the condition $W(a_1) = W(a_2)$. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n2.  **C. $50 < a_1 < a_2$**: In this interval, $W(a)$ is strictly monotonically decreasing. If $a_1 < a_2$, then it must be that $W(a_1) > W(a_2)$ (since $a_1$ is closer to the peak at 50). This contradicts the condition $W(a_1) = W(a_2)$. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\n3.  **D. Either $a_1 = 50$ or $a_2 = 50$**: If $a_1 = 50$, then $W(a_1)$ is the maximum weight. For $W(a_2) = W(a_1)$ to hold, $a_2$ would also have to be 50. However, the problem states $a_1 < a_2$, which means $a_1$ and $a_2$ must be distinct. Thus, $a_1=50$ and $a_2=50$ is not possible. Similarly, if $a_2 = 50$, then $W(a_2)$ is the maximum. For $W(a_1) = W(a_2)$, $a_1$ would also have to be 50, again contradicting $a_1 < a_2$. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\n4.  **B. $a_1 < 50 < a_2$**: This is the only scenario where $W(a_1) = W(a_2)$ can hold while $a_1 < a_2$. If $a_1$ is in the increasing part of the function (i.e., $a_1 < 50$) and $a_2$ is in the decreasing part of the function (i.e., $a_2 > 50$), it is possible for the function to have the same value at two different points, one on each side of the maximum. For example, a parabolic function opening downwards with its vertex at $a=50$ would exhibit this behavior. Thus, $a_1$ must be less than 50 and $a_2$ must be greater than 50. Therefore, option B is correct."

    "explanation": {
      "question_nature": "Application",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Understand the function $W(a)$: It represents weight as a function of age, identical for both brothers. The problem states it monotonically increases until age 50 and then monotonically decreases, implying a global maximum at $a=50$ years.",
        "Step 2: Identify the given conditions: two brothers have ages $a_1$ and $a_2$ such that $a_1 < a_2$, and their weights are equal, i.e., $W(a_1) = W(a_2)$.",
        "Step 3: Visualize the function's graph: It's a unimodal curve that rises to a peak at $a=50$ and then falls. This means for $a < 50$, $W(a)$ is strictly increasing, and for $a > 50$, $W(a)$ is strictly decreasing.",
        "Step 4: Consider the implications of $W(a_1) = W(a_2)$ with $a_1 < a_2$. If both ages were less than 50 ($a_1, a_2 < 50$), then since $W(a)$ is strictly increasing in this interval, $a_1 < a_2$ would imply $W(a_1) < W(a_2)$, which contradicts $W(a_1) = W(a_2)$.",
        "Step 5: Similarly, if both ages were greater than 50 ($a_1, a_2 > 50$), then since $W(a)$ is strictly decreasing, $a_1 < a_2$ would imply $W(a_1) > W(a_2)$, again a contradiction. Also, if either $a_1=50$ or $a_2=50$, then for $W(a_1)=W(a_2)$ to hold, both ages must be 50 (as 50 is the unique maximum), which contradicts $a_1 < a_2$.",
        "Step 6: Therefore, the only way for $W(a_1) = W(a_2)$ to be true with $a_1 < a_2$ is if $a_1$ is on the increasing side of the peak and $a_2$ is on the decreasing side. This means $a_1 < 50 < a_2$."

Then, draw a horizontal line representing the 'same weight' (below the maximum). Observe where this line intersects the curve at two distinct points, $a_1$ and $a_2$. This visual immediately shows that if $a_1 < a_2$, then $a_1$ must be on the increasing side (left of 50) and $a_2$ on the decreasing side (right of 50).",

Similarly, on the interval after the peak (e.g., $(50, \\infty)$), it is strictly decreasing and one-to-one. Therefore, if $w(a_1) = w(a_2)$ with $a_1 \\neq a_2$, they cannot both be in the same monotonic interval; they must be in different monotonic intervals, i.e., on opposite sides of the peak (age 50).",
