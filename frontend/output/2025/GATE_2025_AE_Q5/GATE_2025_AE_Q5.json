      "reasoning": "Let the original length of the rectangle be $L$ and the original width be $W$. Given $L > W$.\n\nIf the width, $W$, is increased by 10%, the new width $W'$ will be:\n$W' = W + 0.10W = 1.1W$\nThe length $L$ remains unchanged.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Perimeter increases by 10%.**\nOriginal Perimeter $P = 2(L + W)$\nNew Perimeter $P' = 2(L + W') = 2(L + 1.1W) = 2L + 2.2W$\nPercentage increase in Perimeter $= \\frac{P' - P}{P} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{(2L + 2.2W) - (2L + 2W)}{2L + 2W} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{0.2W}{2L + 2W} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{0.1W}{L + W} \\times 100\\%$\nThis expression is not equal to 10% for all values of $L$ and $W$. For example, if $L=W$, it would be $0.1W/(2W) * 100% = 5%$. If $L$ is very large compared to $W$, the increase would be very small. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**B. Length of the diagonals increases by 10%.**\nOriginal Diagonal Length $D = \\sqrt{L^2 + W^2}$\nNew Diagonal Length $D' = \\sqrt{L^2 + (W')^2} = \\sqrt{L^2 + (1.1W)^2} = \\sqrt{L^2 + 1.21W^2}$\nThe percentage increase in diagonal length is $\\frac{D' - D}{D} \\times 100\\%$. This will not be 10% for all values of $L$ and $W$. For example, if $L=W$, $D = \\sqrt{2W^2} = W\\sqrt{2}$ and $D' = \\sqrt{W^2 + 1.21W^2} = \\sqrt{2.21W^2} = W\\sqrt{2.21}$. The percentage increase is $(\\sqrt{2.21} - \\sqrt{2})/\\sqrt{2} \\times 100\\% \\approx 5.12\\%$. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**C. Area increases by 10%.**\nOriginal Area $A = L \\times W$\nNew Area $A' = L \\times W' = L \\times (1.1W) = 1.1 (L \\times W) = 1.1A$\nPercentage increase in Area $= \\frac{A' - A}{A} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{1.1A - A}{A} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{0.1A}{A} \\times 100\\% = 10\\%$\nThis statement is correct for all values of $L$ and $W$. Thus, option C is correct.\n\n**D. The rectangle becomes a square.**\nA rectangle becomes a square if its length equals its width ($L = W$). Initially, $L > W$. After the change, the dimensions are $L$ and $1.1W$. For the rectangle to become a square, we would need $L = 1.1W$. This is not true for all values of $L$ and $W$ (e.g., if $L=2W$, it remains a rectangle). Thus, option D is incorrect."

        "Recall the original formulas for Area (A = L * W), Perimeter (P = 2(L + W)), and Diagonal (D = sqrt(L^2 + W^2)).",
        "Analyze the change in Perimeter: Original P = 2(L+W), New P' = 2(L+1.1W) = 2L + 2.2W. The percentage change is (P'-P)/P * 100% = (0.2W / (2(L+W))) * 100% = (0.1W / (L+W)) * 100%. This change is not a constant 10% as it depends on the ratio L/W.",
        "Analyze the change in Diagonal: Original D = sqrt(L^2+W^2), New D' = sqrt(L^2+(1.1W)^2). The percentage change is (D'-D)/D * 100%. This change is not a constant 10% as it depends on L and W.",
        "Analyze the change in Area: Original A = L * W, New A' = L * (1.1W) = 1.1 * (L * W) = 1.1A. The percentage change is ((A' - A) / A) * 100% = ((1.1A - A) / A) * 100% = (0.1A / A) * 100% = 10%. This change is always 10%, independent of L and W.",
        "Analyze if the rectangle becomes a square: For a square, L must equal the new width W'. So, L = 1.1W. This condition is only met for specific dimensions (when L is 1.1 times W), not generally true for any rectangle.",
