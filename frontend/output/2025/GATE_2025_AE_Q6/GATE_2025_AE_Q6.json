A helpful and direct response would be an offer to fix it.\n    *   **Response 3: \"No problem, let me clear it up for you.\"** This is a direct offer to help resolve the mess, making it the most appropriate match.\n\n*   **Q. \"I am not happy with the marks given to me.\"**\n    *   This statement expresses dissatisfaction with an academic outcome and implies a desire for intervention or resolution.\n    *   **Response 4: \"Don’t worry, I will take it up with your teacher.\"** This is the appropriate action to address a student's concern about their marks, suggesting advocacy or mediation.\n\n*   **R. \"Politics is a subject I avoid talking about.\"**\n    *   This statement clearly expresses a personal boundary or preference regarding conversation topics.\n    *   **Response 1: \"Alright, I won’t bring it up during our conversations.\"** This response acknowledges and respects the stated boundary, ensuring the topic is avoided in future discussions.\n\n*   **S. \"I don’t know what this word means.\"**\n    *   This statement indicates a lack of understanding regarding a specific word and is a request for information or a definition.\n    *   **Response 2: \"Well, you can easily look it up.\"** This response suggests a self-reliant method for finding the definition, which is a common and practical suggestion in such a scenario. While offering to explain (Response 3) is also possible, if P is matched with 3, then S must be matched with 2.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct matches are: P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2.
