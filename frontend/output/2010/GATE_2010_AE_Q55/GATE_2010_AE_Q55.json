Substituting U1 = 200 m/s, g = 9.81 m/s^2 yields approximately 1.81 x 10^4 m, matching option C."

      "question_nature": "Calculation",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Step 1: Identify the given parameters and the approximate formula for the phugoid natural frequency. The given equilibrium velocity is $U_1 = 200$ m/s and acceleration due to gravity is $g = 9.81$ m/s$^2$. The approximate formula for phugoid natural frequency is $\\omega_{n,ph} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}g}{U_1}$.",
        "Step 2: Relate the natural frequency to the period of oscillation. The period $T$ is given by $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega_{n,ph}}$.",
        "Step 3: Define the wavelength. The wavelength $\\lambda$ is the horizontal distance covered during one complete oscillation at speed $U_1$, so $\\lambda = U_1 \\cdot T$.",
        "Step 4: Combine the formulas and substitute the given values to calculate the wavelength. Substituting $T$ from Step 2 into Step 3, we get $\\lambda = U_1 \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega_{n,ph}}$. Now, substitute the expression for $\\omega_{n,ph}$ from Step 1: $\\lambda = U_1 \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}g}{U_1})} = \\frac{2\\pi U_1^2}{\\sqrt{2}g}$. Plugging in the values: $\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi (200)^2}{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 9.81} \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 3.14159 \\times 40000}{1.4142 \\times 9.81} \\approx \\frac{251327.2}{13.873} \\approx 18115.76$ m. This is approximately $1.81 \\times 10^4$ m.",
        "Step 5: Use the combined formula for phugoid wavelength, derived from the natural frequency, period, and wavelength relationships: $\\lambda_{ph} = \\frac{2\\pi U_1^2}{\\sqrt{2}g}$ (or equivalently, $\\lambda_{ph} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\pi U_1^2}{g}$).",
        "Step 6: Substitute the given values $U_1 = 200$ m/s and $g = 9.81$ m/s² into the formula: $\\lambda_{ph} = \\frac{2 \\pi (200)^2}{\\sqrt{2} \\times 9.81} \\approx \\frac{2 \\pi \\times 40000}{1.4142 \\times 9.81} \\approx \\frac{251327.4}{13.874} \\approx 18115.76$ m.
