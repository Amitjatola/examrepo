For a conventional aircraft in steady level flight, linearized longitudinal dynamics yield an approximate natural circular frequency \\(\\omega_p \\approx \\sqrt{2}\\,g/V\\). The period T is related to the circular frequency by \\(T = 2\\pi/\\omega_p\\). Substituting the expression for \\(\\omega_p\\), we get \\(T = 2\\pi / (\\sqrt{2}\\,g/V) = \\frac{2\\pi V}{\\sqrt{2}g} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\,\\pi\\,V}{g}\\).

The roots of this equation correspond to the phugoid and short period modes.",

Phugoid and short-period modes correspond to poles of the aircraft transfer function; understanding their location helps in controller design and stability margins.",
      "Dynamics": "The derivation of the phugoid mode involves applying Newton's laws of motion and principles of energy conservation to a rigid body (the aircraft).",
      "Aerodynamics": "The stability derivatives used in the full characteristic equation are derived from aerodynamic principles.",
